I am currently a PhD student in [Graduate School of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). I am in [Intelligent mobile-manipulation (IM^2) lab](https://imsquared.github.io/) directed by [Beomjoon Kim](https://beomjoonkim.github.io/).

I am interested in all the things related with creating an intelligent movement of the robot arm including physics simulation, rendering, vision, computational hardware, reinforcement learning, trajectory optimization and actuator.

Previously, I obtained my Master Degree in mechanical engineering from [Seoul National University](https://me.snu.ac.kr/) under the guidance of [Dongjun Lee](http://inrol.snu.ac.kr/), and my Bachelor Degree in mechanical engineering from [Seoul National University](https://me.snu.ac.kr/). I also had worked full-time at Samsung Research, and Hanwha Techwin.
